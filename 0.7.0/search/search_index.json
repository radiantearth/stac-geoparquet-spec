Most all the fields in a STAC Item should be mapped to a column in GeoParquet. We embrace Parquet structures where possible, mapping from JSON into nested structures.

Ideally the geometry types are defined and as narrow as possible.</li> <li>Strongly recommend storing items that are mostly homogeneous (i.e. have the same fields).
